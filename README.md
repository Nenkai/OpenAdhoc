# OpenAdhoc
OpenAdhoc is an open-source re-implementation of the proprietary "Adhoc" scripting language used in Gran Turismo games. OpenAdhoc allows logic-based modding as seen on the [GT6 Spec II Mod](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/beta6-gt6-spec-ii-mod.399796/) and [GT4 Randomizer/Spec II](https://twitter.com/TheAdmiester/status/1658179881186779144), among other fan projects currently in development.

This repository contains compilable game scripts re-created from originally compiled ones. This allows source-code level editing for scripts that have been successfully reverse-engineered in Adhoc-based GT games.<br>
GT4 Prologue, GT4, Tourist Trophy, GT HD, GT5 Prologue, GTPSP, GT5, GT6, GT Sport, and all games in between them are in the scope of OpenAdhoc.<br>

Scripts operate nearly as the whole of game logic, while the executable mostly serves as the engine and exposes libraries to the script interface.
The games use a system of "projects" to divide the major menu types. Each game mode is made out of a project folder containing the Adhoc logic script(s) (.adc), the UI definition script (.mproject), and assets: localization files, textures, models, and animations packaged into container files (.gpb).

> [!NOTE]  
**This code is licensed under GPL-v3. You are required to disclose source/changes including for mods.**
>
> Modified versions of OpenAdhoc for fan projects such as GT6 Spec II & GT5 Master Mod are required to be uploaded to a separate fork.

### GT Sport (gt7sp)
  Adhoc Version: 12<br>
  Only the boot project (1.00) reversed.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>GT7</summary>

### GT7

  Out of scope. GT7 no longer uses Adhoc language and instead uses Swift (custom parser & compiler) which is then compiled to adhoc bytecode.
  <br>

> [!NOTE]
> Original bugs are left as is. You can find any the have been identified with the `// BUG` comments.
</details>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation

[Adhoc Toolchain](https://github.com/Nenkai/GTAdhocToolchain) version 1.3.1 is required to compile game scripts. 
The tool itself is command line-based without a native GUI, however it does have a VS Code Extension, and a Python GUI wrapper for streamlined usage / workflow.
> [!TIP]
Adhoc Toolchain (i.e `adhoc.exe`) can be added to your **PATH** (Optional)

### üîß Compilation process:
* adhoc build -i `path:\to\.yaml\project\file` -o `path:\to\output\.adc\file`<br>
or<br>
* adhoc build -i `path:\to\.ad\source\file` -o `path:\to\output\.adc\file` -v `Adhoc Version (5,7,10,12, etc.)`<br>
or<br>
* "Run Build Task (CTRL+SHIFT+B)" with the VS Code Adhoc Extension on any source file or project file.<br>
or<br>
* Use the Python wrapper script for a straightforward GUI to send commands to the program.

For more details refer to the [Adhoc Page](https://nenkai.github.io/gt-modding-hub/concepts/adhoc/adhoc/) on the Modding Hub.

## üìãContributing & Notes

### 1. Disassembly
* To contribute to OpenAdhoc, the 1st step is to disassemble an original adhoc script (.adc), arriving at an intermediate translation of the bytecode that is understandable enough to convert into full source code.
* The Adhoc toolchain allows disassembling scripts into an assembly-like text form. Most scripts contain symbols which are mandatory and thus allows reconstructing code back into source. Very rarely did syntax have to be made up to support specific adhoc features due to no original source reference, so the documentation is the code.
* To disassemble a script, run the following command: adhoc `path:\to\.adc\file`<br>

### 2. Decompilation
**Translation**<br>
* Understanding how to read the disassembly can be challenging at first. Compare reversed scripts against their corresponding disassembly code to learn.
* Translating by hand is very time-consuming. If you have the patience, you can train an AI model to translate the disassembly for you by having it help you edit code that's already translated,
and attempt to have it decompile disassembly every so often.
* The key to training it is providing a lot of adhoc source code, and over many separate chats over time. It needs to learn the format of adhoc much moreso than the disassembly.
* This can take a very long time before it gets any good, but if it does it can make short work of even the largest scripts.<br>

**Things that are okay to discard**
* Following line numbers - attempting to follow line numbers for code that may be stripped from undefined original preprocessor directives or missing comment blocks can leave holes in the source, therefore prefered not to follow line numbers for better readability.
* Logic order - It is common that scripts were written using such pattern: `nil != myObject` or `"Dog" == myString`. For readability, literals should always be on the right-hand side such as `myObject != nil`.

**Things that should be preserved, or recommended to have**
* All code of any kind should be present in the scripts; bugs should NOT be fixed but should **always** be marked with a `// BUG: <comment>` block. An example of this is usage of undeclared variables, typos.
* Comments to help understand code in general are not needed but appreciated.
* Usage of `PROJECT` and `ROOT` defines should be used everywhere besides the main module declarations.
* Usage of other defines such as `EVENTRESULT` and `PAD` defines (list [here](https://github.com/Nenkai/GTAdhocToolchain/wiki/Builtin-Macros))

### 3. Compilation, comparison, commit
* The 1st roadblock is squashing any mistakes in translating the disassembly if your translated code doesn't at least compile. You'll be on your own until you can get it to compile.
* Once you successfully compile it, the next step is to revise the translated code to get it to completely match the original compiled code. To do so, disassemble both the original .adc and your new .adc.
Use the included python compare script in the Toolchain's scripts folder to diff them. This will output an html file letting you view both disassemblies side-by-side.
Red highlights indicate missing logic, and green highlights indicate added logic. Revise your translated code until all relevant red and green highlights from the comparison are eliminated.
* Once your translated code is fully matching (or at least as close as possible), fork the repo, add your files to your fork, then make a pull request. In the Pull request conversation, add any relevant information
about your new files. If you have any mistakes that you are unable to correct, point them out for review and suggestions.

## üìú History
* August 2020 - Initial breakthrough in Adhoc, dissasembler built based on reverse-engineering
* September 2020 - [Master Mod release for GT5](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/1-8-0-gt5-master-mod.395844/) with hex-edited script code edits
* July 2021 - [GT6 Spec II Mod release for GT6](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/beta6-gt6-spec-ii-mod.399796/)
* December 2021 - Breakthrough. GT Sport Closed Beta build dump, contained a few scripts in source and compiled formats which allowed to figure most of the syntax to be similar to Javascript and Python. Stack understanding later came thanks to a random thought by ddm999 and the first custom "hello world" script compilation within the GT6 Web Server successfully ran to completion.
* January 2022 - First fully recompiled project (`boot`).
* February 2022 <-> December 2022 - Dozens of projects successfully recreated.
* December 2022 - Source release.
