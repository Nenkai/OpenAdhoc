# OpenAdhoc
OpenAdhoc is an open-source re-implementation of Gran Turismo Scripts based on the proprietary Adhoc scripting language to allow logic-based modding as seen on the [GT6 Spec II Mod](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/beta6-gt6-spec-ii-mod.399796/) and [GT4 Randomizer/Spec II](https://twitter.com/TheAdmiester/status/1658179881186779144). 

This repository contains compilable game scripts re-created from originally compiled scripts. The goal is to allow source-code level editing for GT4, GT5, GT6 (and potentially others). Scripts operate nearly as the whole of game logic, while the executable mostly serves as the engine and exposes libraries to the script interface.

> GT6 Spec II & GT5 Master Mod are included in separate branches.

  Out of scope. GT7 no longer uses Adhoc language and instead uses Swift (custom parser & compiler) which is then compiled to adhoc bytecode.

> [!NOTE]
> Original bugs are left as is. You can find a few of them with the `BUG` comments.

## ⚙️ Compilation

The [Adhoc toolchain](https://github.com/Nenkai/GTAdhocToolchain) is required to compile game scripts. It is also recommended to install the VS Code Extension. Binaries/Artifacts can be acquired from the Actions tab.

> [!TIP]  
It is also recommended to add the path to the toolchain (i.e `adhoc.exe`) to your **PATH**.

Compilation process
* `adhoc build -i <.ad source file or .yaml project file>`

or 
* "Run Build Task (CTRL+SHIFT+B)" with the VS Code Adhoc Extension on any source file or project file.

For more details refer to the [Adhoc Page](https://nenkai.github.io/gt-modding-hub/concepts/adhoc/adhoc/) on the Modding Hub.

## 🔧Contributing & Notes

The Adhoc toolchain allows dissasembling scripts into an assembly-like text form. Most scripts contain symbols which are mandatory and thus allows reconstructing code back into source. Sometimes syntax had to be made up for certain specific features, the documentation is the code.

### Things that are okay to discard
* Following line numbers - While the custom toolchain does not currently support defines/macros, it is something that was used therefore can leave holes into the code, same goes for missing comments. It is therefore prefered not to follow line numbers for better readability.
* Logic order - It is common that scripts were written using such pattern: `nil != myObject` or `"Dog" == myString`. For readability, literals should always be on the right-hand side such as `myObject != nil`.

### Things that should be preserved, or recommended to have
* All code of any kind should be present in the scripts.
* Comments are not needed but appreciated.

## 📖 History
* August 2020 - Initial breakthrough in Adhoc, dissasembler built based on reverse-engineering
* September 2020 - [Master Mod release for GT5](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/1-8-0-gt5-master-mod.395844/) with hex-edited script code edits
* July 2021 - [GT6 Spec II Mod release for GT6](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/beta6-gt6-spec-ii-mod.399796/)
* December 2021 - Breakthrough. GT Sport Closed Beta build dump, contained a few scripts in source and compiled formats which allowed to figure most of the syntax to be similar to Javascript and Python. Stack understanding later came thanks to a random thought by ddm999 and the first custom "hello world" script compilation within the GT6 Web Server successfully ran to completion.
* January 2022 - First fully recompiled project (`boot`).
* February 2022 <-> December 2022 - Dozens of projects successfully recreated.
* December 2022 - Source release.
